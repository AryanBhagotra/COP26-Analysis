# __Project Introduction__ :speaker:

## __Welcome To Our Project!__ :wave:

### __Who are we?__

Amandeep and Aryan - two Economists with a keen interest in uncovering the intersectionality between Economics and Data Science! :muscle:

### __Working collaboratively!__

Working well as a team was exactly what made us successfully produce such a _large scale_ project as such a _small group._ We utilised our varying specialities in order to delegate work in a way that ensured __efficiency__ and __proactivity__.

Amandeep had long taken a liking towards the code. Debugging, visualisation and coding were his strong points. Amandeep worked with the code mainly!

Aryan had a strong fortitude for connecting these technical facets to the question at hand. He was able to analyse and scrutinise findings delivered by the data and discern 'patterns amongst the madness'.

Overall our skills tessellated beautifully - we were able to produce our best work through our shared conscientious mindset! üëç

### __What are we doing?__

Our DS105M project is centred around COP26 and the impacts that it had. In particular, how did this climate conference affect the emissions of different countries? By making use of OpenWeatherMap‚Äôs API, we collected __huge__ amounts of data on emissions before, during and after the conference, discerning any relationships! We started off by looking at a select few countries and pollutants, but soon extended it to the __entire world__ :earth_africa:. We compared and contrasted emissions based on levels of economic development (producing a global heatmap for every single country!) :sparkles:

### __Why?__

Each and every year, news of a different climate change conference dominates the headlines :seedling:. It seemed that each conference failed to bring about the change it required. We wondered if these conferences had any impacts on pollution, and whether the impacts were uniform. In fact, our very own __Minouche Shafik__ presented at COP27! As ESG considerations dominate the financial sector, marking a shift from a __shareholder__ to a __stakeholder__ model, we wanted to assess if governments were responding to global climate concerns! :evergreen_tree:

### __What did we find?__

Take a look at our methodology and findings on our GitHub Webpage : [Our Methodology and Findings](https://amandeepn.github.io/COP26-Analysis/) :mortar_board:

### __Give our world heatmap a go!__

Our global heatmap is available for you to try : [Try Our Heatmap](https://amandeepn-cop26-analysis-app-05i6n6.streamlit.app) :raised_hands:

 __HINT__ : you can expand the heatmap using the expand key on the right of the heatmap! Think about a country you are interested in (maybe your home country) :india: and try it out - see what the data shows (it might just surprise you!) :wink:

### __Where could we go next?__

We hope to conduct a similar analysis on COP27 and subsequent climate conferences ‚Äì let‚Äôs see if they have a more pronounced effect on the emission levels! In future projects we would also love to see if positive externalities exist in relation to the COP26 conference (and others like it) ‚Äì did the process of the whole world shining a light on COP26 actually reduce emissions in non-signatory countries by making them think more consciously? :thinking:
