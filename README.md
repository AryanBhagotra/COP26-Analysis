# __Project Introduction__ :speaker:

__What are we doing?__

Our DS105M project is centred around COP26 and the impacts that it had. In particular, how did this climate conference affect the emissions of different countries? By making use of OpenWeatherMap’s API, we collected __huge__ amounts of data on emissions before, during and after the conference, discerning any relationships! We started off by looking at a select few countries and pollutants, but soon extended it to the __entire world__ :earth_africa:. We compared and contrasted emissions based on levels of economic development (producing a global heatmap for every single country!) :sparkles:

__Why?__

Each and every year, news of a different climate change conference dominates the headlines :seedling:. It seemed that each conference failed to bring about the change it required. We wondered if these conferences had any impacts on pollution, and whether the impacts were uniform. As ESG considerations dominate the financial sector, marking a shift from a __shareholder__ to a __stakeholder__ model, we wanted to assess if governments were responding to global climate concerns! :evergreen_tree:

__What did we find?__

Take a look at our methodology and findings on our GitHub Webpage : [Our Methodology and Findings](https://amandeepn.github.io/COP26-Analysis/) :mortar_board:

__Give our world heatmap a go!__

Our global heatmap is available for you to try : [Try Our Heatmap](https://amandeepn-cop26-analysis-app-05i6n6.streamlit.app) :raised_hands:

__HINT__ : you can expand the heatmap using the expand key on the right of the heatmap! Think about a country you are interested in (maybe your home country) :india: and try it out - see what the data shows (it might just surprise you!) :wink:

__What’s next?__

We hope to conduct a similar analysis on COP27 and subsequent climate conferences – let’s see if they have a more pronounced effect on the emission levels! :thinking:
